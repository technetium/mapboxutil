# Creating static Choropleth map images with Mapbox and shapefiles

## An alternative to Google map charts

Since the deprication of the [Google map charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/image/docs/gallery/new_map_charts) API in 2012
there is a need for an alternative way to generate static images for [choropleth maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map).
Here such alternative is discussed with using styled [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) in [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

 - An [account](account.md) for mabox is needed, including secret and public tokens
 - First we need to add a [shapefile](shapefile.md) to mapbox
 - Then we write (python) code to create a [style](style.md)
 - And use the style to create a [static map](static.md)
 - Create a choropleth map of [geocaching](geocaching.md) founds, as an example of the usage of external data
